# Game Architecture-homework2
Second homework for RPI Game Architecture.

In this homework you will implement parts of vector and matrix math library. 
See src/engine/math/ga_vec3f.h and src/engine/math/ga_mat4f.cpp.

To determine if your implementation is functionally correct, the engine runs
some simple unit tests. See src/engine/math/ga_vec3f.tests.cpp and
src/engine/math/ga_mat4f.tests.cpp.

For this homework you must correctly implement the stubbed out methods
in ga_vec3f and ga_mat4f (search for "TODO: Homework 2") and all unit tests
must pass.
